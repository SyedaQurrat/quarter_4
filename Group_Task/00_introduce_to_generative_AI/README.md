**Introduction & Applications**  
Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content—such as text, images, audio, and video—by learning patterns from existing data. It automates creative tasks like report writing, image synthesis, and code generation, finding applications in design, marketing, entertainment, and more.

## How It Works 
![AI works](https://xobin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-45.png)

Generative AI models learn the underlying structure of data and generate new content that resembles the original data. The primary architectures include:

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
Comprise two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—that work in tandem. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce highly realistic outputs.

**Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**  
Utilize an encoder-decoder architecture to compress data into a latent space and then reconstruct it. This approach allows the generation of new data samples by sampling from the latent space.

**Transformers (e.g., GPT):**  
Employ attention mechanisms to process sequential data, making them highly effective for tasks like text generation and translation.
