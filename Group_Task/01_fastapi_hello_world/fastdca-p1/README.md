#  FastAPI Project with UV and Pydantic - DAPR Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) Series

Welcome to the **FastAPI Project** in the DAPR Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) series!  
This project focuses on setting up a FastAPI application using **FastAPI**, **Pydantic** for data validation, and **UV** as the Python dependency manager. You will learn how to create robust APIs, validate data, and integrate **OpenAI Agents SDK** to build a fully functional AI-powered system.

---

##  What Youâ€™ll Learn
- **UV** Python dependency manager setup and usage.
- **FastAPI** setup with UV and basic REST API development.
- Using **Pydantic** models for data validation and serialization.
- Writing **unit tests** using **pytest** for API reliability.
- Integrating the **OpenAI Agents SDK** with FastAPI for agentic capabilities.
- Building simple agent tools and adding them to FastAPI endpoints.

---

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python, command-line tools, and REST APIs.
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- **UV** installed (see instructions below).

---

##  Getting Started

### Step 1: Install UV (Python Project Manager)
**UV** is a fast, modern Python dependency manager that simplifies project setup. You can install it as follows:

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
pip install uv
